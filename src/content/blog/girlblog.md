>__Moana__: Teach me to sail!  
>**Maui**: Pfft  
>**Moana**: My job is to deliver Maui across the great ocean. I should, I should be safe.  
>**Maui**: It's called way finding, princess. It's not just sails and knots. It's seeing where you're going in your mind, knowing where you are by knowing where you've been.  
>**Moana**: Okay, first, I'm not a princess. I'm the daughter of the chief.  
>**Maui**: Same difference  
>**Moana**: No!   
>**Maui**: If you wear a dress and have an animal sidekick, you're a princess. You are not a way finder. You will never be a way finder. You will never be a way... Really? Blow dart in my butt cheek?  

### welcome to my girlblog

writing isn't my strongest suit, but i'm determined to change that, and this is my first attempt. whether or not i produce something well-written in a few months or so isn't the main concern; what matters is that i enjoy the process of girlblogging.

if anyone is reading this, which i doubt, i apologize as my writing will likely be riddled with grammar mistakes. i could probably use the help of LLMs but that would take away the soul of text and that is not what girlblogging is about.

### the girlblog mindset

authenticity. this is what i strive to gain for myself. i am a great fan of hard work and talent, and i have my own set of influential people whom i look up to. i used to pressure myself into believing i should be like them. 

the girlblog mindset—sinking her teeth in and never letting go of it. this is a reminder for me to keep going and that everything will turn out fine if i just put in the work. i am not talking about the grind™ no. i believe this is the opposite of grind. 

> When an artist says "Trust the soup," she means let go of the need to control (which we can't do anyway) and put your faith instead in the Source, the Mystery, the Quantum Soup. - Steven Pressfield, Do the Work pg. 10

girlblogging is not for the faint-hearted. my goal with this is to write with effortless effort, to flow with inspiration rather than force, and to trust the soup.
