> “It’s called wayfinding, princess. It’s not just sails and knots, it’s seeing where you’re going in your mind. Knowing where you are by knowing where you’ve been.” — Maui, Moana (2016)

@ website  
finally setup a now page. inspired by the nownownow movement except this is just my daily log. also added a lovely theme switch so now i have darkmode (hint: it's nicer than light mode)

@ read  
i read papers on recommendations systems.
