> **Rapunzel**: I've been looking out of a window for eighteen years, dreaming about what I might feel like when those lights rise in the sky. What if it's not everything I dreamed it would be?  
> **Flynn Rider**: It will be.  
> **Rapunzel**: And what if it is? What do I do then?  
> **Flynn Rider**: Well, that's the good part I guess. You get to go find a new dream.  

took a break from my ml grind. it's my day of rest and relaxation. i read a few chapters of recommendation systems with jax but that's about it. i would say i did nothing productive today. i tweaked the constrast of this site, i feel satisfied now that it's easier on the eyes. the light mode just MELTS.
